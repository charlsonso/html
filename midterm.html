	<div id="line"><p>I have had 5.2 Patio bookmarked for months and though its down the street, I just choose to go elsewhere, lol.  I finally put myself to it and decided I'm going to go.  I didnt know what to expect cause I cant really make out if its a sit down restaurant, if its a small joint with a few seats around, or if there is no seating at all (these things matter to me when I'm out and about trying to work.  So I walk in and the place has three small tables.  Two of the three tables were taken, so thankfully I got to have one table.  The people working there are super sweet.  I wanted to eat the potstickers, but there were two different styles - one regular and one "yaki".  The yaki potstickers are basically potstickers with teriyaki sauce on/in it.  Of course, I got the one with teriyaki!  For my drink, I needed caffeine!!  haha So, I ordered a cappuccino mocha blast with Boba balls.  The drink was made fairly quick and tasted wonderful!!  The potstickers took a little bit of time, but i'm assuming its cause they make them fresh...?  They tasted amazing as well!!  Between the service and the food/drinks... This place is a for sure winner!!  
If you're in the area, come by and try it out!!</p>

<div id="line"><p>If only I could give negative stars. If your going to eat here make sure you read all the signs!!! Even the small fine print on the menu. Everyone sitting down will be charged period. Oh and no kid prices they don't care if your kids are 5/6 years old full price baby... it's all about the money here.

The food quality is about the same is a K BBQ place I have been to, nothing special nothing to bad. But when you have poor management and bad business practices as far relying on some signage and some smaller print in the corner of the menu to give the rules of engagement to your patron's instead of telling them  up front it's a recipe for disaster.</p><a href="#top"><p>Go to top</p></a> </div></div>

<div id="tofu"><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/cho-dang-tofu-and-bbq-montrose"><div id="line"><h3>Cho Dang Tofu</h3></div></a>
<div id="line"><p>Tofu! Tofu! ... I love tofu! Healthy & non fat, good protein food. I found this tofu house by Yelp and name was familiar. I was passing by this area.
I'm giving this particular branch restaurant a 3.5 stars..

* location /atmosphere: plenty of parking space surrounded by other shops and restaurants. They have covered patio for more seating area.
* originally/food quality: average. Same branch in Cerritos   But different owner? .. that's what they said.
Dining setting and dishes are different than Cerritos Cho Dang Tofu.
* presentation/creativity: average. No appetizer (salad), no fried fish side dish. Ice cream machine wasn't working. 
* waiting time / service: not bad for weekend, fast turnaround time. As usual.. waitress was so focused on fast service and turn over the table... no smile, no talking allowed...lol
* price : average to $.00 higher than others. 

Overall, it was okay. good to know that there was a Tofu restaurant that area.</p><a href="#top"><p>Go to top</p></a> </div></div>
